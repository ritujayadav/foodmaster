This is a machine learning based food detection app

Our ultimate goal is to create a system that would detect the food and thereby encourage people to know about the carbohydrate and calorie values of the food they are consuming. A CNN based algorithm will be used to detect the food items by using machine learning algorithms for data training.

The prototype of our app is

Name of testing and the	things to be tested
1	API testing-	User’s comfort with program should be tested.

2	Unit testing- Every module of the program should be tested.

3	Integration testing- Connection between the modules are tested.

4	System testing- The functional flow of the program are tested.


TEST CASES
1	Importing packages-Packages should be imported successfully-As expected	Pass.

2	Food detection- Name of the food should be detected correctly-As expected	Pass.

3	Calorie detection-Calorie and sugar content should be displayed-As expected	Pass.

4	Camera functionality-Camera should be launched properly-As expected	Pass.

5	Accuracy testing-Report should be generated correctly-As expected	pass.



For data training we have trained 101 food items

The Data is trained in TensorFlow 

We achieved 80% accuracy
